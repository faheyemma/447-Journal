Help sought: 
<br><br><br><br>
I couldn't get Github and Rstudio to communicate, so asked Johannes and Torven in the Mind, Body and Cultural Evolution Lab for assistance. They helped me get GitKraken which allowed the two systems to communicate. Other than that issue, I have gone through all the course content to work out how to complete the above workbook.
